# Description!
_This is a pretty small mod I developed over the weekend, but I'm really excited to share it with you_

The goal of this mod is to provide users with a non-intrusive way to make spells less op in the early game of [Iron's Spells n' Spellbooks](https://modrinth.com/mod/irons-spells-n-spellbooks)

### Vision
Have you ever been playing a modpack, with [Iron's Spells n' Spellbooks](https://modrinth.com/mod/irons-spells-n-spellbooks) and think **WOW! These spells are really powerful and beautiful! but they're kinda overpowered...**

Well this mod is for you! By restricting the spells in the same way Eldritch spells are restricted, it takes a lot longer to get the powerful spells, AND modpack makers can remove the loot tables so they can only be learned through the command **/learnSpell**

I couldn't find a solution I was happy with using, so I made one!

### Goals
- To offer users a way to restrict the mod [Iron's Spells n' Spellbooks](https://modrinth.com/mod/irons-spells-n-spellbooks)
- To add compatibility with select addons that add other schools of magic
- To release a project I am proud of
- For **YOU** to play the game how **YOU** want to

### Permissions
_I_ give permission for anyone to use this mod, or source code how they see fit, as long as they also follow the restrictions and guidelines of [Iron's Spells n' Spellbooks](https://modrinth.com/mod/irons-spells-n-spellbooks) since this wouldn't be possible without them! If you are unsure, _PLEASE_ just ask for permission. I promise I dont bite!

### Credits and Thank you!
I would like to offer a huge thank you to Iron, the creator of the base mod for creating such a great mod, and giving me permission to release this!

I would also like to thank the creators of Neoforge and Neogradle for providing us with this mod loader, and the MDKs which I used to make this mod.
